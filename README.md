# Zomato Landing Page Clone

This repository contains a static landing page clone of **Zomato** built with plain **HTML** and **CSS**.

The goal of this project is to practice frontend layout, Flexbox/Grid, responsive design basics, and recreate UI elements seen on a real-world frontend. It’s not a full app and doesn’t have real backend functionality, so no ordering logic, API requests, or databases here.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully static landing page using semantic HTML and modern CSS  
- Hero section with background and call-to-action  
- Collections and popular items UI  
- Sections mimicking real Zomato landing page look and feel  
- Works in modern browsers
